# ATK_BSS

ATK BSS stands for Ambisonics Toolkit (ATK) Based Spatialization Server (BSS). 
The ATK provides SuperCollider with a large library for ambisonics reproduction 
and ATK_BSS builds a convenient little GUI window on top of it and enables to 
use ATK with the SpatDIF format for OSC messages. 
This lets a sound spatialization environment that sends SpatDIF compliant OSC messages
make use of the rendering engine of ATK.
